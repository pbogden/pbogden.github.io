# DS 5010 -- Introduction to Programming for Data Science

## Official course description

* Offers an introductory course on fundamentals of programming and data structures. 
* Covers:
  * lists, arrays, trees, hash tables, etc.
  * program design, programming practices, testing, debugging, maintainability,
  * data collection techniques, and data cleaning and preprocessing.
* Includes a class project, where students use the concepts covered to:
  * collect data from the web,
  * clean and preprocess the data,
  * and make it ready for analysis.

## 2021 & 2022 Course description

The course is a hands-on introduction to the fundamentals of programming, 
data structures and algorithms for data sciences. 
The course encompasses programming basics such as functions, data structures, and algorithms; 
and their use in design and implementation of data science applications. 
Fundamentals of discrete mathematics for programming with data will be introduced where appropriate. 
The course will also introduce students to programming as a collaborative discipline. 
The course will develop programming experience in Python.

Students are required to get a B or above in the placement courses in order to progress into the core courses in the degree program. Students that do not achieve a B or better in the placement courses will be required to retake the courses.

**Topics**

* Control flow and program logic
* Data types (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets)
* Data structures (arrays, queues, stacks, hash tables, trees, etc.)
* Computational complexity
* Files and I/O
* Object-oriented programming
* Number systems and representation (binary, hex, floating point)
* Programming with vectors, arrays, and matrices
* Source control and version control systems
* Unit tests and system tests

## High level learning objectives (pb draft)

At the end of DS 5010, a student should be able to do the following:

* Acquire data
  * Design and write a program that uses a Python's built-in data structures to...
  * Read and process a large collection (more than 100) of files on a local or remote file system
  * Read and process data from a web-accessible API 
  * Compute basic statistics and create standard charts (histograms, scatterplots, etc.) with Matplotlib
* Document code so others can use it, including:
  * Detailed in-line documentation for functions and modules.
  * API documentation for packages.
  * Clean, well-organized, self-documenting code (and knowing when that's sufficient).
* Write modular code for an entire data processing pipeline that includes:
  * Testing (and test-driven development when appropriate) with standard tools,
  * Error checking, raising exceptions that help with debugging data,
  * Automating tasks when appropriate.
* Manage version-controlled source code for a small project
  * Write project documentation for reproducibility, with proper and authoritative attribution.
  * Develop code collaboratively using git and github command-line tools
  * Use pull requests to communicate and discuss issues with collaborators
* Use common packages for data manipulation and basic visualization (e.g., Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn)
  * Know when to use these packages for efficient implementation of tasks learned in the beginning of the course.
  * Know how to read and use the standard API documentation for usage and customization.
  * Know when to use (and not to use) stackoverflow, google and random blogs on the Internet.
* Read & process common non-tabular data formats (e.g., JSON, GeoJSON, shapefiles)
  * Combine disparate datasets and data types (e.g., with FIPS codes) to facilitate geospatial analysis
  * Perform basic geospatial data visualization using matplotlib
  * Use other standard tools for geospatial visualization and analysis.
* Read code in the other two data science languages (R & JavaScript) for understanding
  * Write functionally equivalent code in Python
