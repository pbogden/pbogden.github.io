#### Priorities

* HPSI
    * fonts -- update interactive chart to use brand fonts (Glypha)
    * fonts -- update social images (GIFs & PNGs) to use brand fonts (Glypha)
    * styles -- update interactive chart according to brand guidelines
* HPSI graph types
    * add two new HPSI graphics -- visualizr.io should offer 3 HPSI options...
        1. This Month's Story -- the current version also has a "Customize" button for all HPSI components
        2. No story -- some months may have no story -- disable/remove the "This Month's Story button"
        3. Custom story -- as with June 2018 release, user adds custom data (1 to 4 custom time series)
* configuration options
    * Axis types/labels -- Date or Quarter (Q1, Q2, etc.)
    * Others...as need arises
* new visualization styles
    * add different types of charts to visualizr.io (e.g., rather than line chart)
    * best approach for offering new capabilities:
        * look at current offerings (e.g, static graphs, PDF reports, etc.), 
        * look at brand guidelines
        * think out of the box, and create something for KP & MC to respond to
    * for example, the [Simple Chart Transitions](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/raw/1256572/) demo was of interest
