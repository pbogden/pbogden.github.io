## Introduction to Data Management & Processing

Introduces students to the core tasks in data science, including data collection, storage, tidying, 
transformation, processing, management, and modeling for the purpose of extracting knowledge from raw observations. 
Programming is a cross-cutting aspect of the course. 
Offers students an opportunity to gain experience with data science tasks and tools through short assignments. 
Includes a term project based on real-world data. (This course description is from the [Academic Catalog](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/ds/).)

## Texts

* ISL: [Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R/Python, 2nd Ed](http://statlearning.com) (2021) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani (and Jonathan Taylor for the Python version).
  * The entire book (pdf) is available for free from the website along with video lectures by Hastie and Tibshirani.
  * ISL concentrates more on applications than mathematical details.
  * Each chapter has a lab in R or Python that is independent of the concept sections.
  * Selected readings from the concept sections will be assigned weekly.
* PDS: [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) (2022) by Jake VanderPlas
  * The entire book is available for free on github in the form of Jupyter notebooks that launch automatically in Colab.
  * This text provides an introduction to core tasks in data science, implemented in Python using standard packages.
  * Chapters 2-4 cover data management, processing and visualization with Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
  * Chapter 5 uses Scikit-Learn to implement many of the topics described in ISL.
* Additional online reading will be assigned for introductions to SQL and relational databases.
* For those new to Python, check out [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython) by Jake VanderPlas
  * This text is also freely available on Github as a collection of executable Jupyter notebooks.

* Weekly topics loosely follow the chapter progression in ISL.
* Additional topics (e.g., neural networks) may be touched on if there's time.

## Approach

By the end of the course students should be able to access and import a dataset,
then clean, transform, and visualize the dataset appropriately for a well-described analytic goal.

* Reading -- Assignments from ISL and PDS should be read in advance of class.
* Polling -- Reading comprehension is measured with online polling during classroom discussions.
* Lecture -- Lectures provide context for in-class exercises and will comprise a small fraction of total class time.
* Exercises -- In-class activities involve collaborative coding and typically account for most of the class time.
* Homework -- Assignments are designed to give students practice coding and using tools on their own.
* Project -- Small groups (2-3 students) will work collaboratively on a practical, stakeholder-driven project.

## Project

Term projects allow students to gain experience working in small teams on practical problems with real-world data.
Typically, these are XN-style projects that involve external stakeholders who help review prototypes
and provide feedback along the way.

* Code development occurs with a shared github repository using basic tools for collaborative coding
such as prototyping in branches, pull requests, merging after independent collaborator review, 
discussing new functionality with "issues", etc.
* Reproducibility, documentation, attribution reproducibility are all critically important.
Documentation should have sufficient detail so that another technical teams could pick up and expand 
upon the project at a later date.
* Projects include a front-facing github-pages site that provides an overview 
understandable by a non-technical audience.  
* Ideally, the github repo and gh-pages site can contribute to student porfolios.

## Development environment

Students are responsible for a standard Python development environment installed on their computer,
including a text editor, and the ability to run code from the command line.
The first class covers recommendations for easy installation on any modern laptop.
