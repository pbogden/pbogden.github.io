The Heilmeier Questions provide high-level guidance for what information should be included in your proposal as well as allow you to communicate to KellerWilliams leadership what you hope to accomplish with the services you offer. 

1. What are you trying to do?
2. How does this get done at present? Who does it? What are the limitations of present approaches? 
    * Are you aware of the state-of-the-art and have you thoroughly thought through all the options?
    * What is new about your approach? Why do you think you can be successful at this time? 
    * Given that you've provided clear answers to 1 & 2, have you created a compelling option?
    * What does first-order analysis of your approach? 
    * If you succeed, what difference will it make? 
    *  Why should we care? 
* How long will it take? How much will it cost?  
    *  What is your program plan? How will you measure progress? What are your milestones/ metrics? What is your transition strategy?
