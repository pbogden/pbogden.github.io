      <p><h3>Millennials, Not Baby Boomers, Are the Driving Force Behind the Recent Surge in Apartment Demand</h3>
         Popular notion holds that downsizing Baby Boomers are a major force behind the recent apartment boom. 
         For example, one recent article noted that the “…magnitude of Boomers’ rental demand [has stunned] 
         some industry observers”, while another asserted that, “…boomers are renting apartments and buying 
         condos at more than twice the rate of their millennial children.”

        <b>The Myth:</b> Baby Boomers are driving demand.
        <br><br><b>The data:</b> Many articles use bar charts like this to argue that Baby Boomers 
               drove a surge in apartment rentals (almost 1 million) between 2009 and 2014.
               It may look that way in the chart.
               But that's <b>not</b> what the data say.
        <br><br><b>The problem:</b> 
               People get older. So age ranges in the bar chart should too, but they don't.
               Baby Boomers ranged in age from 49 to 68 in 2014, but <b>not</b> in 2009.
               In 2009, Boomers were 5 years younger, so the bars should be "younger" too.

      <p id="data1" class="story-text" style="position: absolute; left: 280px; top: 70px; width: 250px;">
        <b>The Reality:</b> Millennials are the driving force. Boomers are aging in place.
        <br><br><b>The data:</b> The bars in this chart change their age along with the generations.
           Viewed this way, the data to tell a very different story.
        <br><br><b>What the data say:</b> 
            Millennials, not Boomers, drove a huge increase in rental demand from 2009 to 2014 (over 2.2 million).
            Baby Boomers account for less than a tenth of that.
            The chart also shows that Generation X and Older Americans actually left the market during that period.
