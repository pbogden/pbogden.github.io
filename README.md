DNS configuration -- see <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/my-custom-domain-isn-t-working/">this page</a>

If serving a top-level domain like example.com, you should have an ALIAS record pointing to username.github.io. 

If you cannot use an ALIAS record, you will need to create A records that point to 192.30.252.153 and 192.30.252.154
