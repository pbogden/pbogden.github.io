    <p><h3>Millennials, Not Baby Boomers, Are Behind the Recent Surge in Apartment Demand</h3>
Popular notion holds that downsizing Baby Boomers are a major force behind the recent apartment boom. For example, one recent article noted that the “…magnitude of Boomers’ rental demand [has stunned] some industry observers”, while another asserted that, “…boomers are renting apartments and buying condos at more than twice the rate of their millennial children.”
<p id="top2">
The problem with these accounts is that they aren’t supported by the data. The misconception that Boomers are a major driver of the increase in apartment demand likely arises from confusion between changes in demand by generation (i.e., a group of persons born during the same period) and by age group. To disentangle these two distinctive ways of looking at demand trends, we have developed a dynamic data visualization tool that allows one to see the net change in apartment (i.e., renter-occupied housing units in buildings with 5 or more units) consumption between <button id="testing" class="button">2009</button> and <button id="testing2">2014</button> by generation and by age.</p>

<p>The left panel of the tool focuses on the generations, who are distinguished from each other by different colors. The right panel of the tool shows apartment consumption for different age groups. The top charts show the total number of apartment units occupied in either 2009 (when the interactive year slider at the top of the tool is in the left position) or in 2014 (when the slider is moved to the right). When the slider is in the 2014 position, the charts at bottom show the net change in the number of apartments occupied between 2009 and 2014 by generation (left side) or by age group (right side).

<p>
Baby Boomers, defined here as those born between 1946 and 1965, occupied millions of apartments in 2009. However, as Boomers have aged, their demand for apartments hasn’t grown very rapidly. Moving the year slider to the right, we see from the chart at lower left only a modest increase in Boomer apartment occupancy between 2009 and 2014.</p> 
<p>
So why the perception that Boomer apartment demand is booming? The answer likely lies in the chart to the bottom right. With the year slider in the 2014 position, we see that the number of apartment dwellers in the 49-68 age group, which Boomers occupied in 2014, grew substantially between 2009 and 2014. As successively larger waves of Boomers have moved into this age group and replaced the much smaller generations that preceded them, they have caused the ranks of late-middle-aged and early-elderly apartment renters to swell. Some analysts see this substantial increase in mature renters and erroneously conclude that large numbers of Baby Boomers are changing their housing behavior; that is, Boomers must be downsizing in droves, moving from single-family homes into apartments. But as the generational charts show, Boomers aren’t consuming many more apartments. Rather, they’re simply aging in place, with those who previously occupied apartments in 2009 carrying that status with them into older age categories in 2014.
</p>
<p>
By far, the most important generational driver of apartment demand growth between 2009 and 2014 was the Millennials. Millennials, here defined as those born between 1981 and 2000, have been reaching adulthood and entering the housing market in large numbers in recent years. For many of these new housing market entrants, the first step in their housing careers after leaving the parental nest has been occupancy of an apartment. As can be seen from the chart at bottom left when the time slider is in the 2014 position, Millennials’ demand for apartments increased by millions between 2009 and 2014, far outpacing the demand growth from the Boomers.
</p>
<p>
As Baby Boomers continue to age into the latter stages of their housing market journeys, their consumption patterns will undoubtedly change, possibly leading to substantially more apartment demand from this market-moving cohort. However, the available evidence suggests that we’re not seeing a major shift of Boomers into apartments yet, and that the true generational driver of mushrooming apartment demand in recent years has been the millions of Millennials who are just beginning their housing careers.
