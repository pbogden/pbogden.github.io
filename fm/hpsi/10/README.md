###Responsive iframe

Demo of a responsive (i.e., constant aspect ratio) iframe for FannieMae.com.

FannieMae.com supports responsive images.  However, FannieMae.com 
does not support variable-height iframe elements.

This demo shows how to create a constant aspect ratio iframe
on FannieMae.com by putting it in a <div> container designed for a PNG.
JavaScript on main page resizes the <iframe>.

Two features are being demoed...

1. iframe.html uses JavaScript to (re)size container for the iframe with a small white PNG
2. index.html uses preventDefault to prevent multi-touch zoom
