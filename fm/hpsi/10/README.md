###Responsive iframe

FM has responsive containers for images (PNG & GIF), but not iframes.

This demo shows how to create a constant aspect ratio iframe
on FannieMae.com by putting it in a <div> container designed for a PNG.
JavaScript on main page resizes the <iframe>.

Two features are being demoed...

1. iframe.html uses JavaScript to (re)size container for the iframe with a small white PNG
2. index.html uses preventDefault to prevent multi-touch zoom
