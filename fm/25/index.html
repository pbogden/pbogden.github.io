      <p><h3>Millennials, Not Baby Boomers, Are the Driving Force Behind the Recent Surge in Apartment Demand</h3>
         Popular notion holds that downsizing Baby Boomers are a major force behind the recent apartment boom. 
         For example, one recent article noted that the “…magnitude of Boomers’ rental demand [has stunned] 
         some industry observers”, while another asserted that, “…boomers are renting apartments and buying 
         condos at more than twice the rate of their millennial children.”

        <b>The data:</b> A lot of articles use bar charts like the one on the right to rationalize the 
               myth that Baby Boomers drove a surge in apartment rentals (almost 1 million) between 2009 and 2014.
               That's <b>not</b> what the data are saying.
        <br><br><b>The problem:</b> 
               This bar chart uses fixed age ranges. Baby Boomers were 49 to 68 years old in 2014, but not in 2009.
               Betwen 2009 and 2014, the generations age 5 years but the bars in the chart do not.

      <p id="data1" class="story-text" style="position: absolute; left: 280px; top: 70px; width: 250px;">
        <b>The data:</b> The bars in the chart (at left) change their age range along with the generations.
            This bar chart tells a very different story. The data are the same as used to rationalize the myth.
        <br><br><b>What the data say:</b> 
            Millennials drove a huge increase in rental demand from 2009 to 2014 (over 2.2 million).
            In comparison, Baby Boomers account for only a small increase (211 thousand).
            The chart also shows that Generation X and Older Americans left the market during that time.
