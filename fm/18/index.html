    <p><h3>Baby Boomers Are Not Leaving Their Single-Family Homes for Apartments</h3>
This chart challenges the perception that Baby Boomers are downsizing from their single-family homes. Available data through 2013, when the housing recovery was two years old, reveal no significant reduction in the rate at which Baby Boomers occupy single-family detached homes. Single-family occupancy has been stable even among the oldest Boomers (those born between 1946 and 1955), who are overwhelmingly empty-nesters and who have begun to retire in large numbersâ€”life changes that might be expected to trigger downsizing.</p>
