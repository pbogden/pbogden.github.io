<h3>Open Data, Open Standards & Open Source</h3>

<p>The "open triad" can turn a browser into a powerful tool for analytics and visualization.
You may be familiar with modern, data-driven graphics already.
The New York Times 
<a href='http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/25/sunday-review/corporate-taxes.html?_r=0' target='_blank'>
has them</a>
all the time. 
These amazing dynamic visualizations demonstrate two parts of the triad: "open-standards" 
and "open-source" software.  
"Open data" completes the triad, and creates new opportunities to
"pluck the diamond from the waste" of the data deluge.
<a href='http://www.economist.com/node/15579717' target='_blank'>This article</a>
in The Economist describes the big data problem.
Time to pluck a diamond...
</p>

<h4>Demo</h4>

<p>
The plots below provide two perspectives on earthquakes that occurred in the last 7 days. 
The Google Map shows their locations, and the scatter plot underneath shows how 
their magnitudes evolved over time.
<a href="http://www.usgs.gov">USGS</a> has been providing these kinds of data for years, and 
these kinds of plots have around for a while.  What's relatively new is that your browser automatically 
loaded the data from USGS and then combined it with the Map it loaded from Google. 
Thanks in part to "open data" and "open standards", this dynamic transaction took no effort on your part.

<p>
What you may not yet realize is that this you also loaded some "open source"
software that you can use to start analyzing your newly acquired data in your browser (provided you
have a modern, standards-compliant browser).  Try it. 
First, click and drag your mouse on the <strong>lower</strong> plot to create a filter for 
the data displayed on the map (use your finger if you're viewing this page on a tablet or smart phone). 
After you create the filter (a gray box on the lower plot), you can drag it along the lower plot 
to dynamically filter the data displayed on the map.  
Once you get the hang of it, you can use the filter to drill down into 
the data and geolocate the largest earthquakes, or the smallest, or the most recent, etc.
The "open triad" has allowed your browser to become an easy-to-use tool that 
blurs the distinction between analysis and visualization.
</p>

<h4>The surface is scratched. Spreadsheets beware.</h4>

<p>
This only begins to demonstrate the potential for new kinds of browser-based applications.
If you're a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table' target='_blank'>pivot table</a> fan, 
then think about how long it would take you to do the same thing with your 
favorite spreadsheet program or GIS, if you could do it at all.
The "open triad" isn't a new spreadsheet application or business-intelligence software product.
It's an approach to data-driven applications and that provides new opportunities
to "pluck the diamond from the waste."
</p>
<h4> Too much data for a browser? Not a problem.</h4>
<p>
Okay, browsers have limitations. So maybe it's time to start talking about the cloud.
<a href="http://potomacboatclub.org">Potomac Boat Club (PBC)</a> is using the cloud to
solve their big-data problem and provid their members a range of browser-based services.  
Their <a href='http://pbc.pbogden.com'>new app</a> includes a variety of data-driven 
visualization and analytics tools, including 
real-time safety reports (i.e., who's on the water, how long have they been out, are they overdue?), 
<a href='http://bl.ocks.org/pbogden/raw/6000283/'>racing ladders</a> for their
super competitive members, resource-utilization reports for their Board of Governors, 
scheduling tools for their fleet of boats, etc.  
PBC's wish list for this new data-driven application is long and it's growing.  
So it's time to start talking about another 21st-century
tech-success story: <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development'>agile software development</a>.
Maybe later. 

<h4>Enough tech talk. Time to row.</h4>
If you like to row, you're fast, you're super competitive, and you don't take yourself too seriously,
then check out PBC's new
