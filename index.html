<h3>Open Data, Open Standards & Open Source</h3>

<p>The "open triad" can turn a browser into a powerful tool for analytics and visualization.
You may be familiar with modern, data-driven graphics already.
<a href='http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/25/sunday-review/corporate-taxes.html?_r=0' target='_blank'>
For example</a>, the New York Times has them all the time. 
They demonstrate two amazing parts of the triad: "open-standards" and "open-source" software.
"Open data" completes the triad and creates incredible opportunities for "plucking the diamond 
from the waste" of the <a href='http://www.economist.com/node/15579717' target='_blank'>data deluge</a>.
</p>

<h4>Tech demo: earthquake data from USGS</h4>

<p>
The plots below provide two perspectives on earthquakes that occurred in the last 7 days. 
The Google Map shows their locations, and the scatter plot underneath shows how 
their magnitudes evolved over time.
<a href="http://www.usgs.gov">USGS</a> has been providing these kinds of data for years, and 
these kinds of plots have around for a while.  What's relatively new is that your browser automatically 
loaded the data from USGS and then combined it with the Map it loaded from Google. 
Thanks to "open data" and "open standards", this dynamic transaction between the business and 
government data sources happened with no effort on your part.

<p>
What you may not yet realize is that this you also loaded some "open source" software
into your browser that you can use to start analyzing your newly acquired  data.  Try it.  
First, click and drag your mouse on the <strong>lower</strong> plot to create a filter for 
the data displayed on the map (use your finger if you're viewing this page on a tablet or smart phone). 
After you create the filter (a gray box on the lower plot), you can drag it along the lower plot 
to dynamically filter the data displayed on the map.  
Once you get the hang of it, you can use the filter to drill down into 
the data and geolocate the largest earthquakes, or the smallest, or the most recent, etc.
The open triad has turned your browser into an easy-to-use tool that 
blurs the distinction between analysis and visualization.
</p>

<h4>The surface is scratched. Spreadsheets beware.</h4>

<p>
This only begins to demonstrate the power of modern, open standards (e.g., HTML5, SVG, JavaScript, JSON),
open source software based upon those standards, and open data resources available for building applications. 
If you're a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table' target='_blank'>pivot table</a> fan, 
then think about how long it would take you to do the same thing with your 
favorite spreadsheet program or GIS, if you could do it at all.
The open triad isn't a new spreadsheet application or business-intelligence software product.
It's an approach to the data deluge that turns a 21st century challenge 
into an incredible opportunity for powerful analytics and applications, that is, for "plucking the
diamond from the waste."
</p>
<h4> Too much data for a browser? Not a problem.</h4>
<p>
Okay, browsers have limitations. So maybe it's time to start talking about the cloud 
as a tool for dealing with big data.
<a href="http://potomacboatclub.org">Potomac Boat Club</a> is solving their big-data problem
in the cloud, and providing their members with a range of browser-based services.  
A prototype of their new <a href='http://pbc.pbogden.com'>custom boat-scheduling app</a> 
uses the same open source visualization software as the New York Times to create
visualization and analytics tools, including real-time safety reports 
(i.e., who's on the water, how long have they been out, are they overdue?), 
<a href='http://bl.ocks.org/pbogden/raw/6000283/'>racing ladders</a> for their
super competitive members, resource-utilization reports for their Board of Governors, 
scheduling tools for their fleet of boats, etc.
</p>
<p>
Their wish list for this new data-driven application is already long and it's growing.  
So now it's probably time to start talking about another 21st-century
tech-success story: <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development'>agile software development</a>.
Next time...that's all for now. 

<h4>Enough tech talk? Then it's time to row.</h4>
If you like to row, you're fast, you're super competitive, and you don't take yourself too seriously,
then check out Potomac Boat Club's new
