<h3>Open Data, Open Standards & Open Source</h3>

<p>The "open triad" can turn a browser into a powerful tool for analytics and visualization.
You may be familiar with modern, <a href='http://d3js.org/'>data-driven documents</a> already.
The New York Times 
<a href='http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/25/sunday-review/corporate-taxes.html?_r=0' target='_blank'>
has them</a> all the time. 
These amazing visualizations demonstrate two parts of the triad: "open standards" 
and "open source" software.  
"Open data" completes the triad, creating new opportunities for
"plucking the diamond from the waste" of the data deluge. (Reference: 
<a href='http://www.economist.com/node/15579717' target='_blank'>The Economist</a>.)
Time to pluck a diamond...
</p>

<h4>Demo</h4>

<p>
The plots below provide two perspectives on the earthquakes that occurred in the last 7 days. 
The Google Map shows their locations, and the scatter plot underneath shows how 
their magnitudes evolved over time.
These kinds of plots aren't new, and <a href="http://www.usgs.gov">USGS</a> has allowed
you to download similar data for years.
What's relatively new is that your browser automatically 
loaded the latest data from USGS and then combined it with the Map it got from Google. 
Thanks in part to the open triad, this dynamic transaction took no effort on your part. 
But wait, there's more...

<p>
What you may not yet realize is that you also downloaded some software that you can use to 
analyze your newly acquired data.
Try it. (Note: it only works with modern, standards-compliant browsers.)  
First, click and drag your mouse on the <strong>lower</strong> plot to create a filter for 
the data displayed on the map (use your finger if you're viewing this page on a tablet or smart phone). 
After you create the filter (a translucent gray box on the lower plot), you can drag 
it along the lower plot to filter (dynamically) the data displayed on the map.  
Once you get the hang of it, you can use the filter to drill down into 
the data and geolocate the largest earthquakes, or the smallest, or the most recent, etc.
The "open triad" has turned your browser into a simple and powerful tool that 
blurs the distinction between analysis and visualization.  That's just the beginning...
</p>

<h4>The surface is scratched. Spreadsheets beware.</h4>

<p>
This only begins to demonstrate the potential for new kinds of browser-based applications.
If you're a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table' target='_blank'>pivot table</a> fan, 
then think about how long it would take you to do the same thing with your 
favorite spreadsheet program or GIS, if you can do it at all.
The "open triad" isn't a new spreadsheet application or business-intelligence software product.
It's an approach to creating data-driven applications that "pluck diamonds from the waste."
If this is sounding like overblown browser hype, then check out
<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QRO3gKj3qw'> what Google is doing with browsers.</a>
(Microsoft is watching them, you can bet on it.)
Time for a real-world application...
</p>
<h4> Too much data for a browser? Not a problem.</h4>
<p>
Okay, browsers do have limitations. So maybe it's time to start talking about the cloud.
<a href="http://potomacboatclub.org">Potomac Boat Club</a> (PBC) is using the cloud and the open
triad to solve their big-data problem.
Now PBC can start to offer their members a range of browser-based, data-driven services.  
Their <a href='http://pbc.pbogden.com'>new app</a> includes 
real-time safety reports (i.e., who's on the water, how long have they been out, are they overdue?), 
<a href='http://bl.ocks.org/pbogden/raw/6000283/'>racing ladders</a> for their
super competitive members, resource-utilization reports for their Board of Governors, 
scheduling tools for their fleet of boats, etc.  
PBC's wish list for their new app is long and it's growing.  
So now it's time to start talking about another 21st-century
tech-success story: <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development'>agile software development</a>.
Maybe later... 

<h4>Enough tech talk. Time to row.</h4>
If you like to row, you're fast, you're super competitive, and you don't take yourself too seriously,
then check out PBC's new 
<a href='https://sites.google.com/site/pbcsmallboatracing/'>Racing Program</a>.  We want you!
