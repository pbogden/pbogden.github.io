<h3>Taking on the data deluge</h3>

The U.S. Government's <a href="https://www.data.gov/open-gov/">open data initiatives</a> 
create all sorts of opportunities. The challenge is to extract
useful information from the <a href='http://www.economist.com/node/15579717' target='_blank'>data deluge</a>.
Recent advances in data visualization can help, as evidenced by some of the stunning graphics at
<a href='http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/25/sunday-review/corporate-taxes.html?_r=0' target='_blank'>
the New York Times</a>.  For example...

<h4>Demo</h4>

<p>
If you're using a modern browser, you'll see two plots below of the earthquakes that occurred in the last 7 days. 
The Google Map shows their locations, and the scatter plot shows when they occured.
These kinds of visualizations aren't new, and <a href="http://www.usgs.gov">USGS</a> has allowed
you to download their data for years.
What's relatively new is that your browser automatically 
loaded the real-time data from USGS when you opened this web page.
The dynamic transaction took no effort on your part. That's just the beginning...
</p>

<p>
You also downloaded some software for analyzing your newly acquired data.
Try it.  First, click and drag your mouse on the <strong>lower</strong> plot to create a "filter" for 
the data displayed on the map. (Use your finger if you're using a tablet or smart phone.) 
After you create the filter -- a translucent gray box on the lower plot -- you can drag 
it along the lower plot to filter (dynamically) the data displayed on the map.  
Once you get the hang of it, you can use the filter to drill down into 
the data and geolocate the largest earthquakes, or the smallest, or the most recent, etc.
Your browser has become a simple and powerful tool that 
blurs the distinction between analysis and visualization.
</p>

<h4>Spreadsheets beware.</h4>

<p>
This only begins to demonstrate the potential for new kinds of data-driven applications.
If you're a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table' target='_blank'>pivot table</a> fan, 
then think about how long it would take you to do the same thing with your 
favorite spreadsheet program or GIS, if you can do it at all.
This isn't a new software product.  
It's a new approach to data analytics and visualization.
