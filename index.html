<h3>Open Data, Open Standards & Open Source</h3>

<p>The "open triad" can turn a browser into a powerful tool for analytics and visualization.
You may already be familiar with modern, data-driven graphics.
<a href='http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/25/sunday-review/corporate-taxes.html?_r=0'>
For example</a>, the New York Times has them all the time, and 
they're an amazing part of the story.  But the 
<a href='http://www.economist.com/node/15579717'>data deluge</a> and various
open data initiatives provide another part.
</p>

<h4>An example -- earthquake data from USGS</h4>

<p>
The two plots below show earthquakes from the last 7 days. The Google Map shows their 
locations for the entire week, and the scatter plot underneath shows how their magnitudes evolved over time.
<a href="http://www.usgs.gov">USGS</a> has been providing similar data for years, and 
these kinds of plots have around for a while.  What's relatively new is that your browser automatically 
loaded the data from USGS and then combined it with the Map it loaded from Google. 
Thanks to open triad, this dynamic transaction happened with no effort on your part.

<p>
What you may not yet realize is that your browser also loaded software that you can use to start analyzing 
the data in your browser.  Try it.  First, click and drag your mouse on 
the <strong>lower</strong> plot to create a filter for the data displayed on the 
map (use your finger if you're viewing this page on a tablet or smart phone). 
After you create the filter, you can then drag it around on the lower plot to change the data 
displayed on the map.  Once you get the hang of it, you can quickly drill down into 
the data to geolocate the largest earthquakes, or smallest, or most recent, etc.
</p>

<p>
This only begins to demonstrate the power of modern, open standards (e.g., HTML5, SVG, JavaScript, JSON) 
and their open source software implementations.  
</p>
<h4> Too much data for a browser? Not a problem...</h4>
Okay. Maybe it's time to start talking about the cloud.
<a href="http://potomacboatclub.org">Potomac Boat Club</a> is solving their big-data problem by putting
their data in the cloud.  A prototype of their <a href='http://pbc.pbogden.com'>custom boat-scheduling app</a> 
uses cloud-based servers for the data, and open source software for a variety of browser-based visualization
and analytics tools, including real-time safety monitoring (i.e., who's on the water and how long have they been out?),
